“Deputy Manager Seo, what is this...?”

“What is that...?”

Director Kim and Deputy Manager Kang whispered, asking each other.

But I was more focused on the drool of the fox falling in front of my eyes than on that.

[A wise human among the pack, I shall not harm recklessly. However, if you wish to stay in my territory, a price must be paid. One of you must offer me a limb to temporarily acknowledge your residence. Who will sacrifice their limb?]

Right.

Since it has come to this.

“I will... offer it.”

Trembling, I stretched out my left arm.

In my past life, when I knew nothing, everyone screamed at the sight of the fox.

And, everyone was left dying with their arms and legs torn apart, eaten by the fox in its fury.

Surviving that was a miracle in itself.

But now, I know the etiquette of the forest and have gained the fox's favor.

Not everyone's limbs.

Not all limbs.

Just one person's limb.

Only one of them needs to be offered.

Even that will be healed by the cultivators who will arrive in two days.

[A wise human indeed. I acknowledge your sacrifice, so I shall taste it as painlessly as possible.]

The fox opened its wide mouth and bit into my arm.

“!!! Ahhhhhhh! Aaargh! Aaaargh!”

My flesh was torn apart by its large teeth.

Bones crushed, blood vessels ruptured.

Crunch, crunch, crunch!

Snap!

Rip!

After chewing on my arm for a while, the fox violently tore it off my body.

“Ah... Argh... Ahh...”

I writhed in pain, half out of my mind, and grabbed a handful of pain-relief herbs I had prepared in advance.

I put them in my mouth, roots and all, and swallowed them.

The dirt and sand in the roots got stuck in my teeth, but that was the least of my concerns.

The pain was unbearable!

After consuming the herbs for a while, the pain started to subside as their effects kicked in.

Crunch, crunch... munch.

Later, the fox that had swallowed my entire arm licked its lips with its tongue.

[I thought it might taste different because of its unique scent. Turns out, it's not much different from ordinary humans. There's a lot of impurities in the blood vessels, making it rough and leaving a bad aftertaste.]

“...I offer this humble tribute.”

[I accept your tribute and permit you to stay in my territory for seven nights. My divine power has infused you, so you shall not die from this wound.]

After saying this, the fox leaped away and disappeared into the forest.

“Hu, huuh... Hah, hah...”

I chewed on a hemostatic herb, applied its juice to where my arm had been torn off, and the bleeding stopped, the pain gradually subsiding.

“Gr... Ugh...”

“Deputy Manager Seo!”

“Deputy Manager Seo Eun-hyun!”

Director Kim and Deputy Manager Kang hurried over to help me.

“What is all this? What was that just now?”

“...First, let's go inside. I'll explain.”

Supported by the two, I entered the cave.

Then, I mixed truth and lies to tell them what happened.

“This morning, I met the fox when I went out early. It told me...”

Eventually, they would find out in a few days anyway.

I pretended the knowledge I already had was what the fox had taught me.

This is not the world we used to live in but a completely different one, inhabited by immortals, hermits, and martial artists.

“...Martial world, huh. This is thrilling.”

“Hehe, never thought I'd experience something like this.”

Director Kim and Chief Oh made jokes about the martial world, trying to lighten the mood despite their disbelief.

“Haha, Deputy Manager Seo. If it's about the martial world, I'm an expert. So, you see...”

But Director Kim's voice trembled, revealing his attempt to hide his emotions.

“Don't die. If you die...”

It wasn't excitement about the martial world, but a forced attempt to divert attention from my pain.

Director Kim and Chief Oh were trying to lighten the mood because they were the oldest here.

“...It's okay. I won't die. The fox said so, with its divine power, I won't die from this wound.”

In my past life, when we didn't perform the ritual, everyone's limbs were torn apart.

Despite the pain that made us wish for death, none of us died.

No, we couldn't die.

“But what about immortals and cultivators?”

At that moment, when Chief Oh was puzzled by my mention of immortals and hermits, Section Chief Jeon stepped forward.

“There are novels called 'Xianxia', not just martial arts fiction."

Jeon Myeong-hoon explained the concept of Xianxia to Manager Kim and Chief Oh.

"I see..."

"Section Chief Jeon, you know some interesting things."

"I've been interested and have looked into it."

'I guess he spent his work hours reading Xianxia novels instead of working...'

So that's why he dumped his work on me.

I almost exploded in anger but quickly let it go and continued speaking.

"Anyway, the owner of this forest demanded a tribute to allow us to stay here temporarily, so I offered my arm. This should keep us safe in the forest for a week."

"A week? What happens after a week?"

"...We'll have to offer another tribute."

At this, everyone's gaze turned towards my shoulder.

Their faces were all pale as death.

"By the way, could you bring me some pain-relief herbs? It hurts a lot."

"Ah, sure. This one?"

"Thank you."

I chewed on another root of the pain-relief herbs I had dug up earlier.

"I'm going to sleep for a bit. Please understand..."

Perhaps due to the shock, I naturally fell asleep as the tension released.

After suppressing the pain with the herbs, I fell into a sweet sleep.

It's said that hearing is the last sense to go.

Perhaps that's why, as I regained consciousness, I could hear the voices of others.

"What? A tribute! That's absurd..."

"After a week, we have to offer another tribute like that?"

"We should think about leaving this place within a week."

"How can we let Deputy Manager Seo suffer like this..."

"Deputy Manager Seo was the first to encounter that... thing and almost got eaten."

"Rather, he was the first to sacrifice."

In a half-asleep state, I continued to listen to the ongoing conversation.

"But what if we can't leave the forest after a week?"

Jeon Myeong-hoon asked in a cold voice.

No one answered.

"Then who will have their limb torn off next?"

Silence hung in the deeper part of the cave.

'In three days... the immortals will appear and kidnap them, so it doesn't really matter.'

There's no need to mention anything about my regression.

That's when it happened.

A rather annoying sound came to my ears.

"Is Deputy Manager Seo sleeping well?"

"Yes... He's completely knocked out."

"Deputy Manager Seo, if you're awake, I have something to tell you. Please wake up."

I kept my eyes closed and pretended to sleep.

Jeon Myeong-hoon checked that I was asleep and then stood up.

"Come to the entrance for a moment."

"Huh? Can't we just talk here?"

"No, come outside."

Eventually, Jeon Myeong-hoon led the others to the cave entrance.

A while later, I heard whispers from the entrance.

Simultaneously, there were voices criticizing Jeon Myeong-hoon.

"Section Chief Jeon! How could you think of something like that?"

"Deputy Manager Seo sacrificed his arm like that..."

"Um. Section Chief Jeon. I really can't approve of that."

"Um..."

Outside the cave, Jeon Myeong-hoon raised his voice.

"Well, who will offer their arm or leg to the monster fox after a week?"

"Even so..."

"Chief Oh, what do you think? I think it's reasonable."

"...I don't know. And Deputy Manager Seo is capable. He knows a lot about herbs and food..."

"Then let's learn as much as we can from Seo Eun-hyun for a week..."

Though I couldn't hear clearly from outside the cave,

I could roughly guess.

'So they're thinking, since I've become disabled, let's cut off my limbs and offer them to the fox every week.'

It's not going to happen, but it feels disgusting.

Very, very much so.

'Should I kill him?'

Even with one arm, the 'violence' I had learned over 50 years in my past life was considerable.

I could easily kill someone like Jeon Myeong-hoon, who hadn't fully escaped modern civilization.

'...No. That's not it.'

The cultivators who will find us in two days didn't come for 'us.'

They came because they found 'talented beings.'

'Chief Oh Hyun-seok, Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee, and Section Chief Jeon Myeong-hoon. They were surprised by the qualities of these three.'

If even one of them is missing, I can't be sure if they'll come.

'Should I beat him to the brink of death? Make him disabled?'

"Anyway, the immortals came to us in the past even when their limbs were severed.

It was likely that they would come even if this guy’s limbs were broken.

However, I soon stopped thinking and shook my head.

'...Everyone must be paralyzed in their head with emotions due to fear. They are all originally good people. It's just that the situation is too sudden and nonsensical.

And if I want to rely on Director Kim later, it wouldn’t be good to show too cruel a face right now...'

It’s better to be seen as a subject of protection or sympathy.

Also, if Director Kim joins in this plot, he would take more care of me in the future due to guilt.

'It’s rather good. Everything will be resolved on the third day anyway.'

In two days, Jeon Myeong-hoon, Oh Hyun-seok, and Kang Min-hee will be people I never see again.

Three days later, Oh Hye-seo and Kim Yeon will be separated as well, and Director Kim Young-hoon and I can leave Dangseonhyang with the help of a monster.

I quietly continued to pretend to sleep on the floor.

After a while, people with dark expressions, as if they had reached some dirty agreement, entered the cave.

'Hey, Deputy Manager Seo. Are you okay? Try getting up.'

Jeon Myeong-hoon deliberately woke me up, pretending to be asleep.

‘'Haha, Deputy Manager Seo. Sorry about that. I didn’t know you were such a self-sacrificing person.'’

‘'...'’

‘'From now on, I'm counting on you.'’

Jeon Myeong-hoon looked at me with a smile I had never seen before and patted my back.

I looked around at the people nearby. Everyone’s expression was dark.

'This garbage, I see how he persuaded everyone with his silver tongue.'

For a moment, annoyance surged, and I even considered strangling and killing the guy who hugged me.

'Endure. Phew, just hold on.'

‘'...Yes. We all need to survive together in a difficult situation.'’

‘'Haha, right. So, about the fruit you picked yesterday. Do you know where to find it?'’

‘'...'’

This bastard, so he woke me up for this.

‘'...I can teach you. Actually, I was planning to teach you, Section Chief Jeon, in particular.'’

‘'Ha, really? Thanks! Thank you!'’

‘'Don’t worry about surviving in the forest. I’ll teach you everything.'’

I gave him a sly smile.

Yeah, I’ll teach you all this knowledge.

After all, it's knowledge you won’t need for the rest of your life once you join a cultivation sect

 

‘'Jeon Myeong-hoon. How many times have I told you it’s not that fruit. You're not focusing on my words, are you?'’

‘'No, but surely...'’

‘'The one with the split top is a different fruit. Eating this fruit will kill you. Do you understand?'’

‘'...'’

While teaching Jeon Myeong-hoon about herbs and edible fruits, I no longer called him 'section chief.'

He was learning about herbs while grinning, even though I was scolding him.

'I wonder how frustrating it will be when he realizes these are low-grade herbs useless for a sect disciple.'

‘'No, Jeon Myeong-hoon. Can’t you understand? I’ve explained several times. You have a problem with concentration.'’

‘'...I get…it'’

Jeon Myeong-hoon's face turned as red as raspberries.

Jeon Myeong-hoon was being tormented in the same way he used to torment me when I first joined the company.

He must be enduring it with the thought of extracting as much knowledge as possible in a week.

Sorry, but we won’t see each other again in two days.

‘'Look here. This is called green-leafed ear, and it emits a unique fragrance when chewed. It can be used for brushing teeth and repelling insects.'’

‘'Green-leafed ear, green-leafed ear...'’

‘'Hmm, but I’ve never heard of these in Korea...'’

Deputy Oh Hyun-seok tilted his head, looking a bit confused.

‘'They are somewhat specialized plants, and since they are not native species, you may not be familiar with them.'’

Of course, they don’t exist on Earth.

I’m using the knowledge of herbs I learned in this world.

But Deputy Oh Hyun-seok, not being an expert, seemed to believe it roughly.

‘'That's right. Please continue.'’

‘'This is called blue baby's hand vein, also known as blood-purifying grass. Ah, Jeon Myeong-hoon. You’re not listening to me now, are you?'’

‘'...Sorry, right.'’

I continued giving Jeon Myeong-hoon noticeable looks while persisting with the herbal medicine class.

The day passed by like that.

And the next day.

We had to confront a huge red snake with two heads staring at us in front of the cave.

"Hi, hiik..."

"Huuh..."

The others trembled in fear, holding things like branches inside the cave, and I cautiously spoke to the snake.

"...What brings you here?"

The snake spoke.

[The master of this territory has tasted a human with a unique scent.]

Though not as much as foxes, snakes were quite fearsome to me.

Of course, compared to foxes, it wasn't really traumatic.

[Of course, since you've offered sacrifices to the master of the territory and received permission to stay for seven nights and days. I will not bother you during that time. However...]

The snake licked its lips with its two heads.

[If you allow me to taste even a little of your blood, I won't bother you even after seven nights and days.]

Unlike the fox that tore off my arm, the snake was quite moderate.

Even in my past life, when I wasn't recognized by the fox, this two-headed snake just came, bit into Chief Oh's body, sucked his blood, and left.

But now, it was even asking for our permission to take some blood.

'It should be fine.'

Our bodies, being modern, were full of cholesterol and fat.

Thanks to that, in my past life, the snake left after tasting Chief Oh's blood, saying it was tasteless.

"How much blood do you want?"

[A handful. Just a handful of blood. Then, I'll leave.]

I smiled and looked at Jeon Myeong-hoon.

"Mr. Jeon Myeong-hoon. Could you give this gentleman some blood?"

"What, what?"

"It's not like I'm asking you to sacrifice an arm, just a handful of blood. That should clot quickly."

"I, I..."

"Ah, Mr. Jeon Myeong-hoon. Don't you need knowledge of herbs?"

"...Alright."

With a flushed face, Jeon Myeong-hoon cut his hand with a sharp stone knife he had made.

Drip, drip...

The snake joyfully consumed Jeon Myeong-hoon's blood.

A little later.

[There are many impurities in the blood. Even poison. A terrible taste... The worst I've tasted compared to any human's blood.]

The snake shook its two heads and retreated.

The blood of a 21st-century office worker, laden with cholesterol and nicotine, was not tasty

[Anyway, since you let me taste the blood, I'll leave.]

After the snake left, I applied hemostatic herbs to Jeon Myeong-hoon's wound.

Jeon Myeong-hoon was quite annoyed, probably feeling dirty from being licked by the snake.

"Mr. Seo Eun-hyun. I know I bullied you a lot in your early days at work, but isn't that a bit too much?"

"What can I do? It's hard to ask the ladies or older executives like the Chief and the Director to give blood."

"A handful of blood should have been enough for you..."

"...I just had an arm severed yesterday, and I'm a bit short on blood. Even a handful is a lot for me."

"Kuhk..."

Jeon Myeong-hoon bit his lip and took a breath.

'Funny guy. He plans to sell me to a fox in a week.'

He's just resentful because I sacrificed him.

Anyway, he can't do anything to me.

'Well, I won't see him after tomorrow...'

I thought I should take advantage while I could and started to hassle Jeon Myeong-hoon more.

Thus, three days passed since we fell into this forest.

Whoosh, whoosh...

The wind was strong from dawn today.

Zap, zap...

At the same time, the air felt turbulent.

I smiled and woke up Jeon Myeong-hoon early in the morning.

"Mr. Jeon Myeong-hoon, let's go pick some herbs in the morning."

"Right from the morning..."

"Ah, hurry up."

"...Alright."

I took Jeon Myeong-hoon around, searching for herbs.

And a little later.

"Oh, I found it!"

"Is this a good herb?"

"Yes, it is."

"It does look like ginseng..."

Jeon Myeong-hoon swallowed his saliva looking at the plant resembling wild ginseng in front of him.

The plant was a type of ginseng called Yellow Bamboo Root.

It wasn't particularly rare.

But what mattered was the size of the ginseng.

Perhaps because it absorbed heavenly energy, the yellow bamboo root, normally the size of a pinkie, was now as thick as my forearm.

"Hahaha, oh, this is incredible. Is it really okay to dig up so much wild ginsengs like this?”

“...”

Jeon Myeong-hoon seemed to feel exhilaration, but I was chuckling to myself.

'After all, you won’t have the chance to eat such things in the future.'

Even the yellow bamboo roots that Jeon Myeong-hoon had dug up with his own hands, he wouldn't be able to eat.

For cultivators, yellow bamboo root was just a low-grade medicinal herb for mortals.

'Of course, it is used by martial artists for inner energy enhancement... I should give it to Director Kim later.'

“You can try the ginseng later. First, put them here.”

I handed over a pouch I made from tearing my clothes. Jeon Myeong-hoon carefully put the ginseng into the pouch.

“Let’s return now.”

It was about time to head back.

I went back to the cave, had Jeon Myeong-hoon start a fire, and sat down.

And it was when I was quietly sitting and looking up at the sky.

Kwagwang! Kwakwagwang!

Suddenly, there was a flash, and something collided in the sky.

It seemed like a collision of black, golden, and pure white lights.

And then, at that moment.

“Kuhuk! Kuaak!”

Suddenly, Jeon Myeong-hoon spat blood and collapsed.

“Aaak, Aaaak!”

Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee also screamed and collapsed. Her screams echoed around like a ghostly wail.

Additionally, Chief Oh Hyun-seok also collapsed, clutching his heart.

'It’s time.'

A little while later.

Paaat!

Above the cave we were in, three orbs of light flew down.

[Wow, amazing. To think I’d find such gems while bumping into these annoying folks.]

[Who’s talking. Get lost, Byuk-ho. These guys are all mine.]

[Such shameless talk. Huak.]

From within the orbs of light, a middle-aged man in a golden robe, a figure in black robes that made it unclear whether they were male or female, and a giant in blue armor stepped out.

“Yo-you are... who...?”

Director Kim asked them with a fearful voice.

However, they glanced at Director Kim and ignored him.

[No spiritual roots.]

[Just ordinary mortals.]

[They’re irrelevant to my treasures.]

Their gaze swept over each of us in turn.

[Do these three have spiritual roots?]

[But it’s amazing. How did these untrained mortals end up in Dangseonhyang...]

[Hehe, it seems like that fox tricked one of them. From the injury, it seems they offered themselves willingly. Impressive spirit for a mere mortal.]

Kuong!

The giant in blue armor stomped his foot, and a faint turquoise light rippled outwards.

At the same time, when the light touched my body, something amazing happened. My arm, enveloped in a sky-blue light, regrew.

“Th-thank you!”

I bowed deeply to the giant, overwhelmed with gratitude. The giant laughed heartily and said.

[No need to be so formal. For a cultivator, restoring a mortal’s blood essence is quite easy. Anyway...]

Click

The giant in blue armor flicked his hand towards the air.

At the same time, my body was pushed back, and Jeon Myeong-hoon, Chief Oh, and Deputy Manager Kang’s bodies were pulled forward.

[These three have spiritual roots, shall we see who’s worth it?]

The middle-aged man in the golden robe stepped forward and extended his hand.

A golden sword then floated above his hand.

Wooong!

Pajijik!

Simultaneously, golden lightning roared in the sky, and Jeon Myeong-hoon collapsed again, spitting blood.

[As expected... amazing! A body of Heavenly Golden Thunder...!]

[Move, it’s my turn.]

The figure in black robes, ambiguous in gender, pushed the man in the golden robe aside and took out a black pipa from the bag.

Tung―

As the pipa string was plucked, Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee clutched her head and screamed.

“Aaak!”

Her screams once again echoed like ghostly wails.

The figure in black robes showed a slight smile.

[Ghostly Yin Transforming Immortal Root...! To think it actually exists! Aaaa...]

[Hehe, I also believe what I felt was not a lie.]

The giant in blue armor walked past the figure in black robes and approached Chief Oh Hyun-seok.

“What, what is it?”

Chief Oh seemed fearful, but the blue-armored giant surprisingly checked his pulse, holding his wrist calmly.

And after a while.

[A Unique Holy Body! Can such a body really exist! Impossible...]

A little while later, the three, seemingly shocked, calmed their hearts and then asked us.

[Would you like to consider the path of cultivation?]

The middle-aged man in the golden robe spoke to Jeon Myeong-hoon with a gentle expression.

[Each of you has the talent to turn the world upside down. It’s unthinkable to waste such talent.]

The figure in black robes looked at Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee with a lingering gaze.

[Immortality! The power to turn heaven and earth upside down! Immense wealth and honor! Don’t you want it all? I assure you, if you follow me, you will obtain everything within 100 years.]

The giant in blue armor openly approached Chief Oh Hyun-seok, massaging his body and said.

[I am the Grand Master of the Heavenly Golden Thunder Sect, Jin Byuk-ho. How about all three of you join my Heavenly Golden Thunder Sect?]

[Hmph, so greedy! In our Black Bone Valley, there’s no such thing as a missing attribute technique. I am the Elder of the Black Bone Valley, the White Bone Ghost Horse. If all of you join our valley, you can achieve maximum growth.]

[Well, I don’t really need those two. Just you, come along, Unique Holy Body. I am the fourth-generation sect leader of the Heaven Creation Sect, Lee Chang-ho. If you wish, I’m even willing to pass on the sect to you. Oh, the other two can come if they wish. Though different in direction, you both have tremendous talent, so I’ll take you as direct disciples.]

While the three cultivators seemed to be giving them a choice, in reality, it was no different from a forced threat.

The giant in blue armor, known as Chang-ho, was practically crushing Chief Oh Hyun-seok’s shoulder.

The gender-ambiguous figure in black robes, the White Bone Ghost Horse, was doing something suspicious while making eye contact with Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee.

Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee's eyes were gradually becoming dull.

And Jin Byuk-ho seemed to be pressuring Jeon Myeong-hoon with an invisible force, as if threatening to kill him if he didn’t choose him.

After a while, Jeon Myeong-hoon, Chief Oh Hyun-seok, and Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee were forced to join the three cultivation sects.

[Welcome to the sect, haha!]

[The Elders of the valley will take good care of you.]

[Come, my disciple, let’s go.]

The three cultivators were about to take off with the three people.

Just then, Director Kim, who was watching the situation in a daze, suddenly regained his senses and ran out.

"Wait, wait a moment! Excuse me! Can you possibly help us out of this forest? If we stay here, we're all going to die!"

"Hmm, are you so worried because you're mortals? Worried about that fox? Don’t worry."

The giant in the blue armor, Chang-ho, laughed and spoke.

"We've already beaten all the demons and monsters in Dangseonhyang on our way here! Now we're going to catch that fox too, and for the next 10 years, Dangseonhyang will be safe!"

"Ah, no... Look here! Section Chief Jeon! Chief Oh! Deputy Manager Kang! Say something! We don’t even know how to get out of here!"

In reality, Jeon Myeong-hoon was already captured by Jin Byuk-ho in a golden bottle like a Pokémon.

Deputy Manager Kang Min-hee was completely entranced by the White Bone Ghost Horse.

Chang-ho just laughed off whatever Chief Oh Hyun-seok said, seemingly uninterested.

'It was like this 50 years ago.'

Those three were irresponsible and out of their minds.

No matter how loudly we shouted, they didn't pay any attention to us, as if we were just insects, and went on their way.

Instead of calling out hoarsely to the three cultivators, I touched my arm that had been restored.

'Well, at least they restored my arm.'

I sighed and thanked Chang Ho inwardly.

Director Kim shouted till his throat was hoarse as he watched the three orbs of light disappear, but there was no response.

"Ugh... Damn it..."

Eventually, Director Kim just collapsed.

"What are we supposed to do... in this forest..."

Now only four of us were left.

Me, Director Kim Young-hoon, Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo, and Manager Kim Yeon.

'Tomorrow, Deputy Manager Oh and Manager Kim will probably be kidnapped too...'

My time alone with Director Kim was coming shortly.

Director Kim was momentarily disheartened but was overjoyed and congratulated me upon seeing my arm had been restored.

"It's really a relief, truly a relief..."

"Exactly. Moreover, that Chang-ho said he'd catch the fox too. If we only aim to survive, it seems we can make it."

"Hoo...I see..."

"When Deputy Manager Seo's arm was torn off, I thought I was going to lose my mind... Ah, but even now, it’s really, really shocking to see three of our colleagues disappear like that..."

"Deputy Manager, it's truly fortunate."

We, who had lost our colleagues yet had our lives assured in this strange situation sat there, unable to cry or laugh.

And then, a little later.

Like a meteor passing through the sky, a pure white light streaked across the sky.

"Oh, what..."

It wasn’t just that.

After the white light, several, dozens of lights flew across the sky like a meteor shower.

All were headed in the direction where Jin Byuk-ho, the White Bone Ghost Horse, and Chang-ho had flown.

"What is this... Is there something in that direction..."

Director Kim looked in that direction in confusion, and I started to gather fruits to eat for the day, lighting a fire to roast them.

Tomorrow, it will be time to part ways with Deputy Manager Oh and Manager Kim.

Sssssss―

The next day came.

This day was unusual as it rained.

Dark clouds filled the sky, and thunder rumbled.

"...With this weather, it'll be hard to go out for fruits. What should we do?"

Manager Kim looked at us with a worried expression.

"...Especially since Deputy Manager Oh isn't in good condition."

It was true.

Deputy Manager Oh Hye-seo was lying down with a high fever, looking at the sky with a vacant expression and muttering to herself.

"...Let's wait a bit longer."

I said, looking up at the sky.

"Who knows, maybe another miracle like yesterday will happen today."

"...Is that really a miracle? Oh, of course, your arm coming back is really... like a miracle, but..."

I chuckled and said to Manager Kim.

"Who knows. Someone might appear and cure Deputy Manager Oh's illness completely."

I looked up at the sky with Manager Kim and Director Kim.

It was lunchtime.

Kwarurung!

Thunder roared.

Cough! Cough!

Deputy Manager Oh's cough and fever worsened. Blood flowed from her nose.

"Deputy Manager Seo. Is there any herb we can use for this? What should we do..."

"Let’s try giving her some fever-reducing herbs for now."

That’s when it happened.

Thud, thud...

Someone entered the cave.

He was a handsome middle-aged man dressed in blue robes.

The middle-aged man, with a topknot hairstyle, had a pair of small deer-like horns on his head.

[Mortals in Dangseonhyang. It's like ants getting crushed between the competition of true dragons.]

"Who, who are you!"

Director Kim, vigilant, guarded against this new figure. The man in blue robes smiled wryly and introduced himself leisurely.

[I am the Sea Dragon King, Seo Hweol. I came following the source of the sudden and unnatural stormy weather. That woman over there is using the magic of the stormy weather.]

The man introduced as Seo Hweol pointed to Deputy Manager Oh.

[Well, it’s not exactly magic, but yes. She wields the power of the stormy weather. It's a strain on her human body to cause such massive events.]

"Stormy, stormy weather?"

[Yes, stormy weather. It’s quite unusual. A human, and an ordinary one at that, without even spiritual roots, wielding such immense power... She’s not even doing it consciously. Truly peculiar.]

Peculiar, indeed...

Curious, I asked Seo Hweol a question that had been on my mind.

"In fact, we've experienced events more peculiar. Yesterday, three incredible cultivators took away members of our group who were perfectly suited as their disciples. And today, you came to take a look at Deputy Manager Oh. Why do people as great as you come to us so specifically?"

To my question, Seo Hweol looked puzzled for a moment, then burst into laughter.

[Hahaha, it is so. I'm not sure of the details, but there were mortals among your group with exceptional qualities. Masters fitting those qualities took your colleagues away. And today, I appeared, specifically suited for that woman, is that peculiar?]

Seo Hweol asked me as if amused.

[Look here, mortal friend. Do you know where this place is?]

"From what I've heard, it seems to be called Dangseonhyang..."

[Dangseonhyang. Also known as the Path to Ascension, a gateway leading to the Upper Realm. And in a few months, near Dangseonhyang,  a space rift called the Gateway to Heaven will open.

It’s a once-in-a-thousand-years event. During this time, the surrounding space becomes unstable, and many cultivators and spirits flock to the vicinity of Dangseonhyang. All to ascend to the Upper Realm. All high-level cultivators existing in this realm would have gathered.

So, it’s not impossible that masters specifically suited for you appeared. The same is likely for that woman. If not me, other high-level cultivators or spirits would have found her.]

"Is that so..."

I had thought that some entity that sent us to this world intended to scatter us quickly.

But it seems, in reality, it was just a matter of probability.

"Um, but the cultivators took my colleagues away..."

Director Kim, seeing me initiate conversation with Seo Hweol, seemed to relax and also asked a question.

"They talked about joining their sects and inheriting their methods, but if you ascend to that Upper Realm... how do they get people to join their sects?"

[Hmm, as an ordinary mortal, you might not understand cultivators. Among the skills of cultivators, there is one to shrink large objects for storage.]

Hearing Seo Hweol’s response, I was astonished.

[Perhaps all of them have stored their sects in their storage devices. Their ambition is to ascend to the Upper Realm with their entire sect when the Gateway to Heaven opens. Ah, in fact, I have also placed one of our Sea Dragon Clan’s castles in my storage device. There are about eighteen hundred of our Sea Dragon Clan members sleeping inside it.]

Stunned by his incredible words, both Director Kim and I were at a loss for words.

Swoosh...

Then, Seo Hweol approached Deputy Manager Oh and stroked her forehead.

Her condition, previously feverish and gasping for air, quickly stabilized.

[...Intriguing, really intriguing. If she becomes a member of our Sea Dragon Clan, she might become an extraordinary being...]

Swoosh...

While talking, Seo Hweol picked up Deputy Manager Oh. Director Kim, flustered, tried to stop him but was repelled by an invisible force.

"Ouch!"

[This lady will receive my blood and become part of my clan. That will probably be good for both of us. Since many formidable cultivators will pass through Dangseonhyang, I say this out of concern...]

Flash!

Seo Hweol’s pupils slit vertically.

"Cough! Choke... Argh!"

"Guh... Ugh..."

Both Director Kim and I, who had asked Seo Hweol questions, collapsed under the overwhelming pressure, finding it hard even to breathe.

[Do not carelessly question high-level cultivators. I am good-natured and answered your questions, but some cultivators with foul temperaments could explode you like bugs just for questioning them...]

After speaking, Seo Hweol left the cave.

Flash!

Boom!

With the light, a thunderous roar echoed, and shortly after, we saw a Blue Dragon flying in the sky.

Sssssss―

The rain still did not stop.

Manager Kim looked up at the sky with a hollow look and muttered.

"...Everyone's been taken away. Now I don’t even know what’s what. Suddenly a landslide, suddenly another world, cultivators, dragons kidnapping my colleagues... Ha, haha..."

She covered her face, looking like she might cry.

Director Kim Young-hoon also sighed deeply with a gloomy expression.

"I don’t know what to do. We should try to find a place with people, but I don’t even know where to go. These cultivators and dragons just spout incomprehensible things and... damn it."

"..."

I patted both their shoulders quietly.

Then, suddenly, Manager Kim Yeon grabbed my arm.

"Deputy Manager Seo, you’re not going to suddenly disappear too, right?"

"..."

"Don’t, you can't be kidnapped too, Deputy Manager. If you're taken away too, I won’t have the confidence to survive in this forest..."

I gave a bitter smile.

Tonight.

Lastly, Manager Kim Yeon would be kidnapped by a strange being.
